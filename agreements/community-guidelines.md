# Community Guidelines

**Adhere to the Code of Conduct.** All are welcome here.

**Māʻawe Pono is community-led.** Listen, contribute, and share online and offline.

**Move up, move back.** If you find yourself speaking a lot, try to move back and listen more deeply instead. If you tend to listen a lot, move up and be heard.

**Limit use of jargon and acronyms.** Explain unfamiliar words (e.g. industry slang)

**Speak for yourself.** Use "I" statements to take ownership of your feelings and experiences. (e.g. what I’m hearing is, from my perspective, I felt...)

**Acknowledge one another as strong, capable humans.** We all have needs and values.

**Embrace the awkward.** Be kind and show compassion.

**Explore and try.** Just because you meet a dead end, doesn’t mean you’re a failure.
